<h1>Hi</h1>
<p>
    My name is Kevin Federico. I am a theoretical physicist with interests broadly in the fields of quantum 
    information, quantum gravity, and condensed matter physics. Currently I am a PhD student at CU Boulder 
    working with Chris Akers. I completed my undergraduate degree at Lehigh University advised by Timm Wrase.
    I am curious about how we can use what we have learned in quantum gravity to talk about many-body 
    quantum systems and vice versa. To this end, quantum information provides a unifying theoretical language and
    quantum computing promises an experimental framework. I am particularly excited about attempts to experimentally
    realize quantum gravity on quantum computers.   
</p>

<p>At the moment, I find myself thinking about</p>
<ul>
    <li>The role of complexity in effective theories</li>
    <li> What are the details of the holographic map between the effective quantum gravity theory and the fundamental quantum theory? Are such maps unique to holography or more general to effective theries and their fundamental counterparts? </li>
