<h1>Hi</h1>
<p>
    My name is Kevin Federico. I am a theoretical physicist with interests broadly in the fields of quantum 
    information, quantum gravity, and condensed matter physics. Currently I am a PhD student at CU Boulder 
    working with Chris Akers. I completed my undergraduate degree at Lehigh University advised by Timm Wrase.
    I am curious about how we can use what we have learned in quantum gravity to talk about many-body 
    quantum systems and vice versa. To this end, quantum information provides a unifying theoretical language and
    quantum computing promises an experimental framework. I am particularly excited about attempts to experimentally
    realize quantum gravity on quantum computers.   
</p>

<p>At the moment, I find myself thinking about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What role does complexity play in effective theories?</li>
    <li>What are the details of holographic maps? Are such maps unique to holography or more general in nature? </li>
    <li>Are there many-body systems which exhibit an emergent spacetime dimension? What would signatures of this look like experimentally?</li>
    <li>What is Warhol's glue trap?</li>
    <li>Why do mathematicians never come to blows? Why do philosophers?</li>
  </ul> 
<p>
    In the past I have worked on:
<ul>
    <li>The absence of localized intersecting sources in supergravity  <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09873>arxiv</a> </li>
</ul>
